# What is DevSecOps?
To me it is a whole lot more complicated than the acronym implies. Development, security, and operations. The core idea being that we make everyone accountable for security as early in the software development lifecycle as the development and deployment of the software itself.

# How did we get here?
DevOps has been around for awhile. The idea that you should be deploying your code to production like environments as frequently as possible and automating that process is not a new one. It was a nightmare to try and deploy a software product after months of development in a silo. Now when a feature is committed it is common to see it deploy into an environment, often named Acceptance, to be tested as soon as possible. But what about security? It is typically a pre production set of processes that ultimately determines if the code meets the security requirements to deploy into production. Naturally, these processes fall similarly into the same bucket as waiting to deploy for a long time did. So, let's ***shift*** security as far ***left*** in the process as possible.
