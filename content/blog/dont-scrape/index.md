For whatever reason, I get paid money to scrape data pretty often. Here's how Andy and I handle it, and how you can work faster by avoiding it. There are code snippets included that cover how to scrape and how to scrape <b>really fast</b>. The GitHub links are included for convenience below. Linkedin, email, or tweet us with questions! Huge thanks to Andy for putting together the "API hunting" screenshots, and co-leading this lecture with me!

We didn't cover GraphQL too deeply, it's worth taking a look at deeper. It's the next "big thing" in internet stuff.
