Hi, I'm John. I'm a machine learning engineer with Nextech Solutions, LLC. I hold a masters degree in data science from Southern Methodist University, and a series of less useful degrees. I've worked on everything in tech from machine learning to satellite dishes. I am incredibly fortunate, and have had some incredible mentors along the way that nudged me in the direction that I'm in now.

I somehow nabbed this awesome domain name, and I plan to use this platform to amplify "sensible defaults" for DevSecOps practices, while bringing in my friends from academia and industry to show the internet cool stuff. This will also host all of the content I've left languishing in google docs and slides over the last year or two. My big list of python resources will be here!

Chances are this will end up being a bit of an internet-evernote for me, capturing stuff I work on that is cool. My biggest goal is to help bring more folks into the software fold. If you think I can do that, please drop me a note! I love suggestions.
