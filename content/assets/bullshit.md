Hello folks, I'm Anthony(Tony). Formally, I am the Director of Technologies and Innovation at CSEngineering. Informally, I am a Tech evangelist, nerd, geek, Dad, Husband, veteran, market speculator, and a whole lot of other things.  

I plan to use this platform to share my experiences inside the world of government tech and how I went from being 30 years behind the technology adoption curve to pioneering new ways to operate in the most popular frameworks employed today. I am a big believer in hard work and dedication! I want to share all the ups and downs I've had chasing problems and being an overall disruptor in tech.

John and I have such unique backgrounds and have worked on such a wide array of tech things that we are busting at the seems with things to share. We both share a passion in building others up. Hopefully, through this medium we can extend our reach to as many as possible. Humbly, I welcome you to sensibleDefaults. Let's learn some stuff and have fun doing it.
